# CB_ICS3U
All of my work from ICS3U
This is a repository containing all the exercises from CBOJ for ICS3U.

Please do not copy code from this repository, though I won't know even if you do. However, if you are caught stealing code from this repository, be warned that you will face serious consequences.
By using code from this Github, you are agreeing that if you are caught stealing code, you will take full responsibility for plagiarizing, and that you will not drag anyone else into it. You will explicitly state that you have plagiarized from my repository, and whatever the reason may be, was in no way anyone else's fault.
This repository is meant only to help those who are really struggling, not those who are too lazy to do the exercises themselves.
