# CB_ICS5U
All of my work from ICS3U
This is a repository containing all the exercises from CBOJ for ICS3U.

Please do not copy code from this repository, though I won't know even if you do. However, if you are caught stealing code from this repository, be warned that you will face serious consequences.
This repository is meant only to help those who are really struggling, not those who are too lazy to do the exercises themselves.
